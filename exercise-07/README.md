# Exercise 07

## [Modules](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/index.html)

This final exercize will be more open-ended depending on what you'd like to do. No solution. 

The goal is to get familiar with modules, which is possibly the most complex capability of Terraform, but really makes the software powerful. 

Two ideas:

1. Try utilizing a [community-made module](https://registry.terraform.io/)
2. Harder: Try encapsulating our stack from the previous exercise into a simple to use module (so it functions more like a re-usable component), and then prove it works by using it in a different configuration.
