# Exercise 07

## [Modules](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/index.html)

Finally this exercise is more open-ended depending on what you'd like to do. No solution-files, as we sadly didn't get around to it. 

The goal should be is to get familiar with using and creating modules. They allow you to use configurations in a more re-usable component based way. Think of it as accessing a component as a kind of "black-box" (hide all the gritty details but expose the necessary variables).

Two ideas:

1. Try utilizing a [community-made module](https://registry.terraform.io/)
2. Harder: Try encapsulating our stack from the previous exercise into a simple to use module, and then prove it works by using it in a different configuration.
3. If you're hardcore, use the output of one module in another module...
